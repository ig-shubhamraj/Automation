Hey
I want to share the Errors faced me through this project

1- Make sure that you used Eclipse version works with java version 8, the latest versions from eclipse don't work with JDK8
  I used Eclipse 03-2019, Java 8 and Gradle 7.4 
  You don't need to uninstall your java version you can update your JAVA_HOME and Path From Edit the system environment variables.


2- Mutant Error "Learner did not properly terminate mutant version!" you can download "Pitclipse" from Eclipse Marketplace. 
It will help you to figure out in which line you don't have enough test cases to cover all valid and invalid cases.
